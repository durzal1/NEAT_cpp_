# NEAT_cpp_
To date this is the most
complex project I have done and it is an algorithm I implemented from scratch based on consulting with
others on various forums and reading the original research paper. As I have stated to fully understand this
project I read different forums of how other people implemented it and the changes they made. Based on
this I created my own implementation that I made 100% of the code for in C++. The main concept of the
algorithm is a genetic algorithm that evolves the Neural Network over time. However, instead of having a
fixed Topology or in other words Neural Network size it starts with no connections and builds upon that
with the power of evolution. This new method allows the algorithm to solve a problem with the
theoretical smallest possible Topology. The way it grades a Neural Network is a variable called Fitness.
The higher the Fitness the better the Neural Network solves the problem. This project was extremely fun
and difficult to make and I had to solve various problems. One problem I came across specifically was
when I was testing this program out with the XOR problem and it would not work. After hours of
messing around with my mutation rate and changing my mutation function, I finally got it to work. This
algorithm has many uses specifically in simple games where the User has a few options.
