SDL/SPEED
1) try getting rid of every instance of sdl to make it faster
2) only use one window
3) instead of getting rid of everything just dont update the sdl window and dont use it in snake
4) it takes a really long time when it gets stuck on the left-right left-right

IMPROVEMENTS
1) try a different fitness function
2) use different inputs

works with his implementation but not mine 
maybe its because of the angle
