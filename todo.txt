SDL/SPEED
1) try getting rid of every instance of sdl to make it faster
2) only use one window
3) instead of getting rid of everything just dont update the sdl window and dont use it in snake
4) it takes a really long time when it gets stuck on the left-right left-right

IMPROVEMENTS
1) try a different fitness function
2) use different inputs
3) got a sigsegv error at gen 20 (think it has to do with sdl so not worreid about it)

REMOVE its dependency on SDL
