SDL/SPEED
1) try getting rid of every instance of sdl to make it faster
2) only use one window
3) instead of getting rid of everything just dont update the sdl window and dont use it in snake
4) it takes a really long time when it gets stuck on the left-right left-right

IMPROVEMENTS
1) try a different fitness function
2) use different inputs

make my snake like his
make sure apple cannot spawn inside of the snake(do this first)
the main problem with mine rn is it just doesnt learn to not hit itself so i prob messed up my border input or smth
